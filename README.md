## Projects

###   Personal Cloud Portfolio - Cloud Infrastructure Development & Automation

This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and automate cloud infrastructure on AWS.

* **Static Website Deployment:** I deployed a highly available static website on S3, integrated with EC2 instances to showcase dynamic content delivery and application integration.
* **Secure VPC Architecture:** I designed and implemented a secure and scalable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture with segmented public and private subnets, configured security groups, and NACLs to control network access and protect resources.
* **Cost Optimization:** I analyzed AWS resource utilization and cost using AWS Cost Explorer and implemented strategies such as right-sizing EC2 instances and leveraging S3 lifecycle policies, resulting in a simulated cost reduction of 15%.
* **Infrastructure Automation:** I automated the provisioning of AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances, VPCs, and IAM roles, using CloudFormation templates.
* **EC2 Backup Automation:** I developed a Python script using the AWS SDK (Boto3) to automate the backup of EC2 instances, including creating snapshots and managing retention policies.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** I designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild to automate the build, test, and deployment of applications.
